<h1 align = "center" id = "title">Analysis</h1>
I analyzed the data using various statistical and visualization techniques. I used pandas to clean and manuplate the data, Seaborn and Matplotlib to create visualizations. I looked at factors such as GDP per capita, freedom to make life choices, and preceptions of corruption to identify the keys of happiness across the region. I visualized the data using various graphs and charts, including scatter plots, bar charts, subplots.

<h1 align = "center" id = "title">Conclusion</h1>
My analysis in shown that the factors that contributes vary widely across different countries. Example freedom to make life choices are important factors of happiness, preception of corruption have greater impact on happiness in some region than others. Overall, my analysis is provides valuable insights that how many factors can affect the happiness of diffrent countries and regions.
